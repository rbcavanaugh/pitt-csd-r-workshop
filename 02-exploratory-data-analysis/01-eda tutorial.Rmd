### Where we were?

-   Installed R and R studio

-   Learned to install packages/load packages

-   Learned about R environments (super helpful, not regularly taught.
    Be bold!)

-   Learned how to load data sets

-   Name data sets

### To the future, exploratory data analysis:

> Exploratory data analysis is the first step in most research projects.
> Generally, exploratory data analysis, or EDA, is a task that
> statisticians, data scientists, and researchers complete to visualize
> their data graphically or tabular to help: 1. Gain a basic
> understanding of the central tendencies of your variables 2. Explore
> the relationships between variable 3. Generate and answer questions
> about your data

> The ultimate goal of EDA is to use what you have learned to refine
> research questions, or even generate new ones.

### The easiest way to develop an EDA pipeline is to utilize a series of questions to use as tools to guide your investigation. These questions should help focus your attention on certain aspects of your data, and ultimately help you decide what types of tables, graphs, and statistical models to make.

#### Generating summaries of your data

#### Data visualization:

-   Summarize tabular data
-   Visualize variation of single variables
-   Visualize covariation of multiple variables
-   Lots of coding

#### 1: install the following packages

-   dplyr
-   tidyr
-   ggplot2
-   gridExtra
-   GGally

##### Following the example below, install the remaining packages

##### Response 1:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}}
#example
install.packages('dplyr')

```

##### Solution 1:

```{r}
# install.packages('dplyr') # data manipulation
# install.packages('tidyr') # data manipulation
# install.packages('ggplot2') #plotting
# install.packages('here')
```

#### 2. Load the packages with the `library()` function. Please also load the library `readr`. Note, unlike the `install.packages()` command, you do not have to put package names in quotes or apostrophes when using `library()`.

##### Response 2:

```{r}
#example
library(readr)
```

##### Solution 2:

```{r}
library(readr) #used to load csv files
library(dplyr) # data manipulation
library(tidyr) # data manipulation
library(ggplot2) #plotting
library(here)
```

#### 3: Load data set. Use the `read_csv()` to load the following data set: hearingLoss.csv and name the data set `df`

##### Response 3

```{r}
#Load  data set here. 

```

##### Solution 3:

```{r}
df = read.csv(here('data', 'hearingLoss.csv'))
```

### the below list contains data manipulation and helper functions to insure all exercises work properly below. Please make sure to run this. You do not need to understand the code at this time. However, you will understand these functions after tomorrows lecture on data manipulation.

```{r}
df = df %>%
  mutate(id = as.factor(id),
         sex = as.factor(sex),
         HearingAidUse = as.factor(HearingAidUse),
         hl_mild = as.factor(hl_mild),
         hl_mod = as.factor(hl_mod),
         NIH_mod = as.factor(NIH_mod),
         NIH_severe = as.factor(NIH_severe),
         sr_hl = as.factor(sr_hl),
         sr_hl2 = as.factor(sr_hl2)) %>%
  select(-X)

df_long = df %>%
  select(id, age, sex,  lpta, rpta) %>%
  gather(ear, pta, lpta:rpta) %>%
  mutate(ear = ifelse(ear == "lpta", "Left Ear", "Right Ear"))
```

#### 4: After loading the data set we can use a series of commands to examine the structure of the data, the names of the variables within the dataframe, and provide summary statistics of the data.

##### 4.1 Use the `str()` command to look at the shape of df, learn the variable names, and variable types. Then, answer the questions below.

##### Response 4.1

```{r}

```

##### Solution 4.1

```{r}
str(df)
```

##### 4.1.1: How many variables are in the data set?

> Response:

##### 4.1.2: How many observations are there for each variable?

##### 4.1.1-Solution: How many variables are in the data set?

> Response: The first line that is output after running `str(df)` can be
> used to answer this question along with 4.1.2. there are 17 variables.

##### 4.1.2-Solution: How many observations are there for each variable?

> 111 observations \#### Data Visualization:

#### The `head()` command is also a useful tool for gaining an understanding of the structure of your data. By default it outputs the first 6 observations from each variable in your data set.

##### 4.2: Use the `head()` to examine the first 6 rows of your data.

```{r}


```

##### 4.2 solution

```{r}
head(df)
```

#### Next we can investigate the variation of each variable. The `summary()` function is extremly useful for this. You can run the summary function on a single variable within a data set or all variables within the data set. We will do both.

##### 5.1: use `summary()` to produce summary statistics for all variables for df. This is done by placing the data framename within the function itself.

```{r}

```

##### 5.1 solution

```{r}
summary(df)
```

##### 5.1.1 Using the output from summary, identify and report the mean age of the participants in the study?

##### 5.1.1 solution:

the mean age of the participants in this study is 74.15.

##### 5.2: Generate a summary of left pure tone average (variable name = lpta).

```{r}
summary(df$lpta)
```

#### 6: Summarizing categorical variables. As can be seen the summary function does not provide very useful information regarding categorical variables such as `id`. It is worth noting that it is common to have multiple participant ids in the same column if there is an additional variable in the data framedenoting timepoint. Use the the combination of `length()` and `unique()` to identify the number of participants in the study.

\*\*Hint, you will need to nest one function inside the other.

```{r}

```

##### Solution 6:

```{r}
length(unique(df$id))
```

## Onto visualization.

### Univariate visualizations:

> There are many ways to visualize data in R. Including the base R
> functions and ggplot2 (gg = grammar of graphics). In this workshop we
> will rely heavily on the ggplot2 package because of its ability to
> generate high resolution images that are publication ready.

#### Ogres are like onions, they come in layers. ggplots are like ogres, they also come in layers.

> When generating plots within the ggplot framework it will be helpful
> to remember that each time you use the + sign, you are adding a new
> layer to the figure.

> The first line of code when creating a figure in ggplot2 is
> `ggplot()`. The first argument that must me met within this function
> is telling ggplot where the data is coming from.

##### 7: Fill in in the blank of the function below and run the command to generate the ggplot template for most figures. This will look like a white piece of paper, a perfect starting point for our figures. Make sure to remove the hash prior to ggplot()

```{r}
#ggplot(data = )
```

##### Solution 7:

```{r}
ggplot(data = df)
```

#### `ggplot(data, aes())`

> The second argument within the `ggplot()` command is `aes()`. aes
> stands for aesthetics and is a function itself. Within the aes section
> you can define you x and y variables. - `aes()` follows a `,` after
> the data's name - `aes()` is nested within both of the parentheses
> corresponding to the `ggplot()` function. - variable names within aes
> do not require the dataframes name followed by the dollar sign because
> you have already told ggplot the name of the data set. - declare x and
> y variables within the aesthetic function like this: aes(x =
> NameOfVariable, y = NameOfVariable)

##### 8: Use `aes()` within the `ggplot()` command to declare `age` as the x axis variable.

```{r}

```

##### Solution 8:

```{r}
ggplot(data = df, aes(x = age))
```

##### 8.1: What do you see? What did the additional layer add to the figure?

> After declaring your data and the variables of interest within ggplot,
> as done above and provided in solution 8, we can tell ggplot what type
> of plot we want to produce. Nearly always, if not always, this command
> will start with `geom_` and following the underscore will by the type
> plot you want to make. - these commands follow the root ggplot command
> above following a \`\`\`+\`\`\`\` sign. It is good practice to hit
> return after the plus sign.

##### 9:

> The histogram. A histogram is a popular and useful figure for
> identifying the type of distribution your variables are. the command.
> the command to generate a histogram is\
> `geom_histogram()`. You can also use the function `geom_bar()`

-   You do not need to write the variable name within geom_point()
    because you have already told ggplot both the data's name and the
    variable of interest.

##### Add the geom_histogram function to the above code to generate a histogram for age.

##### Response 9.1

```{r }

```

##### Solution 9.1

```{r histogram }
ggplot(data = df, aes(x = age)) + 
  geom_histogram()
```

##### 9.2: Generate the same plot with the `geom_bar` function instead of `geom_histogram`

##### Response 9.2

```{r histogram }

```

##### Solution 9.2

```{r histogram }
ggplot(data = df, aes(x = age)) + 
  geom_histogram()
```

##### 10. Customizing plots. Ggplots are highly customizeable. You can change nearly every aspect of any figure.

##### 10.1: Let's start by changing the color of the border lines of the histogram. To complete this task, add `color =` within the `geom_histogram()` line of your plot. Following the equal sign of color, type the name of a color of your choice within quotation marks.

-Some colors are not available by name. If you get an error message here
read the message and decide if it is because the color was not
recognized.

##### Response 10:

```{r}

```

##### Solution 10:

```{r}
ggplot(data = df, aes(x = age)) + 
  geom_histogram(color = "blue")
```

##### 10.2: Change the fill color your histogram by adding `fill =` after the color command with a color of your choosing.

-   Don't forget a comma!
-   Don't forget quotes

##### Response 10:

```{r}

```

##### Solution 10:

```{r}
ggplot(data = df, aes(x = age)) + 
  geom_histogram(color = "blue", fill = "light blue")
```

##### Adding labels.

> The following labels can be added to your ggplot - `title =` - Name of
> the figure, displayed on top - `subtitle =` - displayed below the
> title - axis labels - customize x and y axis labels with `x =` and
> `y =` - `caption =` - Text will be displayed in the bottom right of
> the plot - `tag =` - text will be displayed in the top left of the
> plot

> Labels are added with the `labs()` command. - `labs()` should follow
> the ending parenthese of your geom function. In the working example,
> following `geom_histogram` - The above commands all go within the labs
> function. - All text for each label type should be within quotation
> marks. - Spaces are a-okay in labels! - Following each label name and
> the ending quotation mark add a comma and hit return to add your next
> variable.

##### 11.1: Add a title to your plot, be short and descriptive, for example "Histogram of age"

##### Response 11.1

```{r}

```

##### Solution 11.1

```{r}
ggplot(data = df, aes(x = age)) + 
  geom_histogram(color = "blue", fill = "light blue") +
  labs(title = "Histogram of age") 

```

##### 11.2: Change the x and y axis labels to `Age in years` and `Count`. Do not remove the title.

-   Why is it important to change the x axis variable name in this case?

##### Response 11.2

```{r}

```

##### Solution 11.2

```{r}
ggplot(data = df, aes(x = age)) + 
  geom_histogram(color = "blue", fill = "light blue") +
  labs(title = "Histogram of age",
       x = "Age in years",
       y = "Count")
```

##### Bringing it all together. Independent exercise 1:

> Use ggplot to create a histogram for left pure tone average. This
> variable is labeled lpta. - Modify the color of the fill and color of
> the bins - Generate a meaningful title - Change x axis to "Left ear
> pure tone average" - Change y axis to "Number of Observations" - Bonus
> 1: within geom_histogram add the `bins =` function to change the
> number of bins to 50. - Hint: no quotes here. - Bonus 2: add a density
> curve over your histogram with geom_dens - hint: You will need to
> google how to complete this step. - hint 2: remember to include
> keywords in your search cush as "ggplot" "histogram" and "density
> curve".

##### Independent exercisesolution 1

```{r}

```

##### Independent exercisesolution 1:

```{r}
ggplot(data = df, aes(x = lpta)) + 
  geom_histogram(color = "red", fill = "blue", bins = 50, aes(y = ..density..)) +
  geom_density() +
  labs(title = "Histogram of left pure tone average",
       x = "Left ear pure tone average",
       y = "Number of Observations")

```

#### Plotting two variables:

##### Independent exercise2: What is the code below doing? Use your own words. What has it achieved and not achieved?

-Hint: compare this histogram to the above histogram of lpta.

```{r}
ggplot(data = df) +
geom_histogram(aes(x= lpta)) +
geom_histogram(aes(x = rpta))
```

##### Independent exercise2.2: Try adding colors to see if that helps.

##### Response independent exercise2.2:

```{r}

```

##### Solution independent exercise2.2:

```{r}
ggplot(data = df) +
geom_histogram(aes(x= lpta)) +
geom_histogram(aes(x = rpta), fill = "blue")
```

##### Independent exercise 2.3: Have any improvements been made as to the interpretability of the plot? How can we further improve the plot?

> Response:

##### `alpha =`

-   is a method utilized to set the opacity of your plotted variables
    and requires a numerical value between 0 and 1.
-   `alpha = 1` is completely opaque while `alpha = 0` is translucent.
-   declare alpha inside your geom\_ function, but outside `aes()`

##### Independent exercise2.4: Add alpha equals 0.5 to the rpta geom.

-   Hint: don't forget the comma

##### Response independent exercise 2.3:

```{r}

```

##### Solution independent exercise2.1:

```{r}
ggplot(data = df) +
geom_histogram(aes(x= lpta)) +
geom_histogram(aes(x = rpta), fill = "blue", alpha = 0.5)

```

##### Interpretation: Any better? What did we learn? What else does the plot need?

> Response:

##### Adding a legend to wide form data, like we are looking at, is not very easy in ggplot2. You'll cover wide vs long form data tomorrow.

> Your data framestructure is very important when you plot multiple
> variables at once. As seen above, we do not want to just stack two
> histograms together, in this case we lose a lot of information. We
> need to add both color and changes in opacity. In the following
> exercisewe will use a new data frametitled df_long. Prior to plotting,
> check out the data set. It has less variables than df to help focus
> your attention on a few key variables. Use your summary commands to
> report the differences. Pay specific attention to variables `ear` and
> `pta`. - trying using the `unique()` command on ear as well.

##### 12: Investigate the structure df_long

> you will learn how to summarize variables in long form in a later
> lecture.

##### Response 12

```{r}
#structure of df_long

```

```{r}
#head of df_long

```

```{r}
#uinique obervations in variable ear

```

##### Solution 12

```{r}
#structure of df_long
str(df_long)
```

```{r}
#head of df_long
head(df_long)
```

```{r}
#uinique obervations in variable ear
unique(df_long$ear)
```

##### 13: Revisiting independent question 2: Plotting two histograms together.

> With our newly formatted data set, coding the two histogram figure is
> not much different than the single histogram figure. Necessary step: -
> Tell ggplot the variable that dilineates between left and right ear
> for the pure tone averages. - To do this, add the command `color =`
> within the original aes call of your ggplot. - be careful when using
> this function because the default is to stack the histogram, which
> results in higher peaks.

```{r}
ggplot(data = df_long, aes(x = pta, color = ear)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(title = "Stacked histograms resulting in confusingly high peaks")
```

##### To navigate this stacking issue, add the following into `geom_histogram(position = "identity")`.

##### Response 13.2:

```{r}

```

##### Solution 13.2:

##### 13.2: Chanage the color function to fill. What's the difference?

##### Response 13.2:

```{r}

```

##### Solution 13.2:

```{r}
ggplot(data = df_long, aes(x = pta, color = ear)) +
  geom_histogram(position = "identity")
```

##### Note that the figure is still not very interpretable. As above, we are not left with the two histograms on top of eachother. Two steps to fix this as above, add color and change alpha. In the exercisebelow:

-   Change the fill color of the plot
-   Change the alpha level to \~ 0.5

#### 13.3 Try an alpha level of 0.5 for the above plot utilizing fill, not color.

##### Response 13.3:

```{r}

```

##### Solution 13.2:

```{r}
ggplot(data = df_long, aes(x = pta, fill = ear)) +
  geom_histogram(position = "identity", alpha = 0.5)
```

##### 14: Overlapping figures with alpha in black and white coloring can create figures that are hard to interpret.

##### *Thought exercise* Why should we care about whether a figure that looks presentable in color is presentable in black and white?

##### One way to get around these issues is to create a figure with multiple plots imbedded in it. Adding `facet_wrap()` following your ggplot with some slight modifications to your figures syntax is a great way to achieve this task.

-   Like `color()` and `fill()` , `facet_wrap()` creates plots based on
    a categorical variable such as `ear`.\
-   The syntax is slightly different in this case and requires a `~`
    followed by the grouping variables name.
    -   e.g. `facet_wrap(~ear)`

##### Add facetwrap to the above plot and remove all functions adding color and modifying opacacity in the figure The end result should be two histograms in black and white. In addition use the `labs()` command to add a title and change the axis labels. Minimally, change `pta` on the x axis to "Pure tone average" or, for an extra challenge change "pta" to "pta\*" and add a subscript to the x axis plot to write out the long form of the acronym.

-hint: Don't forget we are always adding layers to your original blank
canvas generated by `ggplot(data=df_long, aes(x = pta))`. facet_grid is
just another layer.

##### Response 15:

```{r}

```

##### Solution 15:

```{r}
ggplot(data = df_long, aes(x = pta)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_grid(~ear) +
      labs(title = "Pure tone averages of study participants",
       x = "Pure tone average",
       y = "Count")

```

### Multivariate plots:

> There are many ways to plot multivariate comparisons of variables. The
> next section will focus on scatter plots, using the `geom_point()`
> function. Instead of just providing an x axis variable in the main
> ggplot function we will now have to add a y variable \`\`ggplot(data =
> df, aes(x = var1, y = var2)).

##### exercise15: Generate scatter plot with ggplot

> Use data frame`df` to generate a scatter plot comparing age and pure
> tone average (pta). Don't forget to add axis labels and a title.

###### Response 15:

```{r}

```

###### Solution 15

```{r}
ggplot(data = df, aes(x = pta, y = age)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Scatterplot: L/R puretone average and age",
       x = "Pure tone average",
       y= "Age in years")
```

##### We can now add another dimension to the plot by changing the color of the plot points or the shape of the points.

##### exercise16:

> Following the examples above, change the fill color of the plot points
> to represent the sex of the participant. \###### Response 16:

```{r}

```

###### Solution 16

```{r}
ggplot(data = df, aes(x = pta, y = age, color = sex)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Scatterplot: L/R puretone average and age",
       x = "Pure tone average",
       y= "Age in years")
```

##### Exercise 16:

> To avoid problems of creating plots in color, change the `color`
> command to `shape`

###### Response 16:

```{r}

```

###### Solution 16

```{r}
ggplot(data = df, aes(x = pta, y = age, shape = sex)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Scatterplot: L/R puretone average and age",
       x = "Pure tone average",
       y= "Age in years")
```

#### We can add another dimension to the plot by faceting the scatterplot based on another categorical variable.

> Following examples above, add `facet()` wrap

##### Exercise 17: Create a faceted version the above plot with the "HearingAidUse" variable.

###### Response 17:

```{r}

```

###### Solution 17

```{r}
ggplot(data = df, aes(x = pta, y = age, shape = sex)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Scatterplot: L/R puretone average and age",
       x = "Pure tone average",
       y= "Age in years") +
  facet_grid(~HearingAidUse)
```

##### Exercise 18: The Legend of the plot is not very informative given that sex is coded binary 0,1. I also note the plot is capturing some missing data. You will learn how to deal with this is in a later lecture. To change the legend title and labels add the following command, that is not very intuitive to remember.

-   scale_shape_discrete(name = "TITLE", labels = c("LABEL 1", "LABEL
    2", "LABEL 3"))
-   note participants with 0 identified as male, 1 identified as female

###### Modify the following code to create an informative legend.

-   Hint: What has been added to the solution for exercise 17?
-   Hint: Run the code and see what the newly added line of code has
    added.

```{r}
ggplot(data = df, aes(x = pta, y = age, shape = sex)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Scatterplot: L/R puretone average and age",
       x = "Pure tone average",
       y= "Age in years") +
  facet_grid(~HearingAidUse) +
  scale_shape_discrete(name = "TITLE", labels = c("A", "B", "C"))
```

#### Renaming legend labels for different types of categorical identifiers (color, shape, and etc) requires a unique function. Primarily, the middle term is replaced. See below for a list of the available legend modification methods:

See the following link for helpful functions for working with legend
labels: -
<https://www.datanovia.com/en/blog/ggplot-legend-title-position-and-labels/>

##### Color of lines and points

`scale_color_discrete(name, labels, limits, breaks)` \##### For
linetypes `scale_linetype_discrete(name, labels, limits, breaks)` \#####
For point shapes `scale_shape_discrete(name, labels, limits, breaks)`
\##### For point size
`scale_size_discrete(name, labels, limits, breaks)` \#####
Opacity/transparency
`scale_alpha_discrete(name, labels, limits, breaks)`

#### Adding trend lines to a ggplot.

> Trend lines can be useful for showing the direction of the relationshp
> between two variables. A linear trend line will be a straight line
> that best representions the covariation of two variables. To add such
> a line you can utilize geom_smooth() - `geom_smooth()` has multiple
> options that can be included within it. - the method command provides
> the type of line you want to use, the default is linear.

##### exercise19: Create a scatter plot comparing pure tone average (`pta`) and average words in noise (`win`). Then, add a linear trend line over the scaterplot. You will have to use google or `?geom_smooth` in the command line to figure out how to create the straight linear line

##### Response 19

```{r}

```

##### Solution 19

```{r}
ggplot(data = df, aes(x = pta, y = win)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm)
```

##### exercise20: Expand upon the previos code to instead add two linear lines that show the differences between the relationwship between pta and win when also accounting for sex.

##### Reesponse 20:

```{r}

```

##### Solution 20:

```{r}
ggplot(data = df, aes(x = pta, y = win)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(aes(color=HearingAidUse ), method = lm)
```

##### Exercise 21: Adding another dimension. You can also change the size of the plot points to reflect a continuous variable. Let's try with age. This is called a bubble plot. Task:

-   Modify the size of the points by including `size =` to account for
    differences in age
-   Color plot points to reflect the age group

##### Response 21:

```{r}


```

##### Solution 21:

```{r}
ggplot(data = df, aes(x = pta, y = win)) +
  geom_point(aes(color=HearingAidUse, size=age)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(color=HearingAidUse ), method = lm)
```

##### Exercise 22: Add another dimension to the plot by faceting by the sex variable.

-   In addition:
-   Modify axis labels
-   Add a title

##### Response 21

```{r}

```

##### Solution 21:

```{r}
ggplot(data = df, aes(x = pta, y = win)) +
  geom_point(aes(color=HearingAidUse, size=age)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(color=HearingAidUse ), method = lm) +
  facet_wrap(~sex) +
  labs(x = "Pure tone average",
       y = "Words in noise average",
       title = "Scatterplot of pure tone average and words in noise average")
  
```

##### Bonus 1: Box plots: Box plots are a nice way to compare the mean and variance of multiple variables. They are great to compliment t-tests. The following plot is created with df_long.

##### Bonus 1 example:

```{r}
ggplot(df_long, aes(x = ear, y = pta)) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = ear))
```

##### Bonus exercise 1: Create a box plot comparing pta across Hearing aid users. You will need to use the df data set for this comparison.
