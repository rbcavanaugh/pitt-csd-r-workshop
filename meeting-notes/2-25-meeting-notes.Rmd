# Pitt CSD R Workshop - Meeting notes

## Friday Feb 25, 2022

### Next meeting

Alex, Emily and I will focus on slowly putting together the course for orientation week and we will separate the potential survey from the workshop content and return to it in the summer.
 
Tentative deadlines:
 
Late May/early June: Draft syllabus ready for team feedback including clear content overview and learning objectives
Late May/early June: Begin putting together IRB for tracking outcomes/survey
Early June: begin reaching out to other programs for potential participants
Early August: content is near ready to go. Perhaps a dry run with pittsburgh research slps/ interested faculty or other PhD students at Pitt.

# Next meeting:

begin to discuss content areas.
