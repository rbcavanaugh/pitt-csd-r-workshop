### Data visualization:

-   The practice of translating information into a visual context

-   Helps make complex data easier to understand

### Goals:

-   Teach you how to produce useful and meaningful graphics in R

-   Understand when and when not to use a graphic.

-   Lots of coding on the participant end.

### Libraries

The required libraries for this tutorial include `ggplot2` . As learned in previous lectures, please install and load the library below.

Good practice when working in rmarkdowns is to `#comment` out any installation lines of code, because some installs can be lengthy.

```{r}
#install ggplot2 below.
replace_me_with_code
#load the library ggplot2 below
replace_me_with_code
```

```{r}
#install ggplot2 below.
#install.packages('ggplot2')
#load the library ggplot2 below
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
```

### Load data

To provide some new code, today we will load data directly from github. Instead of providing a path on your local machine, we will just provide the website and the type of datafile.

```{r}
meir_osf = knitr::include_url('https://osf.io/3eg4x/wiki/home/')
```

#### About the data

The data to be loaded below comes from 34 individuals with aphasia.

```{r}
df = read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rbcavanaugh/pitt-csd-r-workshop/master/DataViz/osf_meir%20and%20Bangash.csv")
```

### Take a peak at the data 

There are a couple ways to look at your data structure once it has been loaded. we will use the summary function below. This dataset includes information from 34 people with aphasia and includes 33 different variables. As you will see when you run the summary function, the output is not always easy to parse when there are a large number of variables.

#### Run the summary function by inserting the dataframe name into the the summary function

```{r}
summary()
```

Solution

```{r}
summary(df)
```
