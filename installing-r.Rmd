# Learning Objectives:

-   [x] Install R, Rstudio, and some R packages (tidyverse)...do before?
-   Understand basic terminology around R
-   Describe difference between RMarkdown, R scripts, and the console
-   Follow a project-based workflow for working in R
-   Identify 2 ways to get help

# What is R, and why use it?

R is a *free* programming environment for data processing and statistical analysis. R allows you to write scripts that combine data files, clean data, and run analyses. R is really useful for conducting reproducible research (research that documents all of the steps between raw data and results in a way that can be verified), automating analytical steps, creating custom high-quality visualizations, and conducting a wide range of statistical analyses from basic t-tests to multivariate multilevel Bayesian regression.

This document details steps to get started in R as part of the R for researchers in Communication Sciences and Disorders workshop (August 2022). It synthesizes already-published materials for teaching R in a way that is tailored to this workshop. Anyone interested in the full materials can find them here: <https://psyteachr.github.io/>.

# Installing R

[Install base R](https://cran.rstudio.com/). Choose the download link for your operating system (Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows).

If you have a **Mac**, install the latest release from the newest `R-x.x.x.pkg` link (or a legacy version if you have an older operating system). After you install R, you should also install [XQuartz](http://xquartz.macosforge.org/) to be able to use some visualisation packages.

If you are installing the **Windows** version, choose the "[base](https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/base/)" subdirectory and click on the download link at the top of the page. After you install R, you should also install [RTools](https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/Rtools/); use the "recommended" version highlighted near the top of the list.

If you are using **Linux**, choose your specific operating system and follow the installation instructions.

If you have trouble with installation, R can also be used online: [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/) is a free online service that allows access to R and RStudio.


```{r, out.width = "400px", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/paste-8DC0F4C7.png")
```


# Installing RStudio

Go to [rstudio.com](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) and download the RStudio Desktop (Open Source License) version for your operating system under the list titled **Installers for Supported Platforms**.

If you're unsure about where something is in RStudio, try finding it in the cheatsheet here: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/rstudio-ide.pdf>

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "500px"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/paste-B4148C41.png")
```

There are a few settings you should fix immediately after updating RStudio. Go to **`Global Options...`** under the **`Tools`** menu (âŒ˜,), and in the General tab, uncheck the box that says **`Restore .RData into workspace at startup`**. If you keep things around in your workspace, things will get messy, and unexpected things will happen. You should always start with a clear workspace. This also means that you never want to save your workspace when you exit, so set this to **`Never`**. The only thing you want to save are your scripts.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "500px"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/paste-EA4637C3.png")
```

### Installing LaTeX (optional)

You can install the LaTeX typesetting system to produce PDF reports from RStudio. Without this additional installation, you will be able to produce reports in HTML but not PDF. To generate PDF reports, you will additionally need to install **`tinytex`** ([Xie, 2022](https://psyteachr.github.io/reprores-v2/bookrefs.html#ref-R-tinytex)) and run the following code:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

### Installing Packages

"base R" (everything that comes with the initial installation of R) comes with many basic functions for data wrangling, plotting, and statistical analysis, but most people (including us, and this workshop) use additional packages that add additional features to R.

The main repository where packages reside is called [CRAN](https://psyteachr.github.io/glossary/c#cran "The Comprehensive R Archive Network: a network of ftp and web servers around the world that store identical, up-to-date, versions of code and documentation for R."), the Comprehensive R Archive Network. A package has to pass strict tests devised by the R core team to be allowed to be part of the CRAN archive. You can install from the CRAN archive with the [`install.packages`](https://rdrr.io/r/utils/install.packages.html)`()` function.

```{r eval = FALSE}
# installs the package tidyverse, which includes data wrangling and viz tools
install.packages("tidyverse")
# installs the package here, which helps with file management
install.packages("here")
# install the package installr, which makes it easy to update R packages
install.packages("installr")
```

*Never install packages within a script, only do this from the console*

Many R packages are not yet on CRAN because they are still in development. Increasingly, datasets and code for papers are available as packages you can download from github. You'll need to install the **`devtools`** package to be able to install packages from github.

```{r eval = FALSE}
# installs the package devtools, which allows you to load packages under development
install.packages("devtools")
# install the package we made for this workshop
devtools::install_github("rbcavanaugh/pitt-csd-r-workshop")
```

### Troubleshooting

Occasionally, you might have a few problem packages that don't install or update cleanly. If you try to update a package and get an error message that says something like *Warning in install.packages : installation of package 'vctrs' had non-zero exit status* or perhaps *Error in loadNamespace(i, c(lib.loc, .libPaths()), versionCheck = vI[[i]]) : namespace 'rlang' 0.4.9 is being loaded, but \>= 0.4.10 is required*. One solution I have found is to manually uninstall the package, restart R, and then install the package new, rather than trying to update an existing version.

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Uninstall the problem package
remove.packages("package_name")

# Then restart R using session - restart R

# Then install the package fresh
install.packages("package")
```
