Why is data visualization important?

Exploratory data visualization:

Investigation of distributions, relationships, and outliers prior to statistical analysis.

Expository data visualization:

Presentations and manusrcipts: Your audience will likely not share your background knowledge and will not be deeply invested in the data. To help others quickly build up a good mental model of the data, you will need to invest considerable effort in making your plots as self-explanatory as possible

When to visualize and when to not

Tips prior to getting started:

-   plots should be assigned a name plot1 = histogram()

    -   allows you to call this plot wherever you want and avoids cluttering your plot output and memory.

    -   Especially helpful with ggplot2, see below.

Topics:

### Univariate graphs:

-   Plot the distribution of data from a single variable.

-   Variable can be categorical or quantitative Bar plot - plots the distribution of a single categorical variable

    -   Categorical: diagnosis and race

    -   Quantitative: metric of severity (Aphasia Severity, Voice Index Handicap, etc)

**Categorical examples:**

-   barplot

-   Pichart

Quantitative examples:

-   Histogram

-   Kernel density plot

### Bivariate graphs:

Visualize the relationship between two variables. Type of figure dpeewnds on measurement level (eg categorical or quantitative)

#### Three types to focus on:

Categorical vs categorical:

-   stacked bar chart (I think i have data and a figure for this)

-   Grouped bar chart

    -   Advantages of one over the other?

Quantitative vs quantitative

-   scatterplot

-   box and whisker

-   grouped kernel density

-   ridge plots

How many dimensions can you see?
